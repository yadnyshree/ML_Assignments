Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. FIRST ON FOX: An Israeli public company says it developed the \"only cure for late-stage COVID \" and said that the results of its phase II clinical trial, disclosed first to Fox News, revealed that patients suffering from severe cases of COVID-19 had a 94% survival rate after being treated with the drug. Israeli biotechnology company Bonus BioGroupâs cell therapy MesenCure was administered to 50 hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffering from life-threatening pneumonia and respiratory distress, the company said, noting that 47 of those patients had survived. \"These are the most clinically meaningful results presented today for treating severe COVID-19 patients,\" Dr. Tomer Bronshtein, the head of research at Bonus BioGroup Ltd., told Fox News in an exclusive interview. Bronshtein said the phase II clinical trial, which recently concluded and took place in several medical centers in Israel, revealed that MesenCure can \"save three out of four people that are at risk of dying\" and \"can reduce their hospital length of stay by half.\" He said it \"will accelerate their healing in a way that will cause less permanent tissue damage and reduce the risk for â long COVID .â\"   Israeli biotechnology company Bonus BioGroupâs cell therapy MesenCure (Bonus BioGroup) The company noted that for each of the first 30 participants in the clinical trial, two patients, also suffering from severe cases, with similar ages and comorbidities, were selected to the \"control group,\" which did not receive MesenCure. After analyzing the data, the company found that Mesencure reduced about 70% of severe COVID-19 patientsâ mortality compared to the mortality in the group that did not receive the drug. The company also noted that about half of the patients with severe cases of COVID-19 who were treated with the therapy were discharged from the hospital up to just one day after the end of the treatment. FAUCI: COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS RISING AMONG VACCINATED \"MesenCure is a drug made from living cells,\" Bronshtein explained, noting that the cells \"are infused into the patient\" and once the cells \"reach their lungs, they fill the inflammation and start secreting molecules and compounds that soothe this inflammation.\"   The MesenCure study found that nearly all COVID-19 patients taking the drug survived. (iStock, File) Bronshtein noted that it also reduces pneumonia and edema, which helps patients \"be able to breathe.\" \"In parallel, [the cells] also ameliorate whatâs called the cytokine storm, which is the hyperimmune reaction that is aggravated in COVID 19,\" he added. Bonus BioGroup argued that it is \"necessary to provide a therapeutic option for hospitalized, severe COVID-19 patients\" given \"vaccines reduce, but do not entirely prevent COVID-19 infection and severe illness, which is also the case with medications designed for at-home treatment of mild COVID-19 that may reduce, but not prevent hospitalization and severe illness.\" PFIZER ASKS U.S. REGULATORS TO AUTHORIZE EXPERIMENTAL COVID-19 PILL \"We have a drug that works and we want to put it to good use,\" Bronshtein told Fox News, adding that currently MesenCure is only available to COVID-19 patients suffering from severe cases through compassionateÂ use in Israel.   Bonus BioGroupÂ has been seeking emergency use approval for the drug in Israel. (iStock, File) The Jerusalem Post reported in August that the Health Ministry had approved the expanded use of MesenCure, which helped 15 out of the 17 patients with severe cases of COVID-19 be released from an Israeli hospital one day after receiving their final dose. Following the results of the phase II clinical trial, Bronshtein said Bonus BioGroup is now seeking emergency use approval starting in Israel. The company is also continuing to run phase III studies.

Bonus BioGroup CEO Shai Meretzki told Fox News he was \"very happy that in less than 18 months we were able to develop a new available therapy for all those severe patients that up to now did not have a solution.\"   Talia Kaplan is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Facebook  Twitter  Instagram  RSS  Email     Coronavirus  Published  3 hours ago   US COVID-19 deaths in 2021 surpass 2020's toll  More than 5M people worldwide have died from COVID-19    By Julia Musto   | Fox News   Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard   Print  Email   close   Video  Fox News Flash top headlines for November 23  Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. COVID-19 deaths in 2021 surpassed the total from 2020 this week, with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data showing cases rising around the country ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday . There have been 771,576 deaths due to the virus since the pandemic started, though that number is currently trending downward. Since Jan. 1 of this year, 386,233 people have died due to the virus, compared with last year's toll of 385,343. COVID VACCINE MANDATE 'WILL NOT IMPACT HOLIDAY TRAVEL,' TSA SAYS, REPORTING 93% OF EMPLOYEES IN COMPLIANCE In 2020, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the U.S., according to an April CDC report on provisional mortality data in the U.S., and figures only account for reported deaths. The global death toll from the pandemic topped 5 million on Monday. The U.S. is averaging more than 90,000 new infections daily and total cases number in the tens of millions.   People visit the 'In America: Remember' public art installation near the Washington Monument on the National Mall on Monday, Sept. 20, 2021 in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Monday that the seven-day average of reported coronavirus infections has increased by 18%. Connecticut , for example, is experiencing a more rapid increase in cases than any other state, averaging 738 daily cases over the last week. The stateâs seven-day positivity rate of 3.07% is the highest since early September, and average daily cases are the highest since mid-September. According to state data, unvaccinated residents are four times more likely to test positive than those who are vaccinated and make up the vast majority of those hospitalized with serious symptoms. As of last week, 74% of all residents had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the state. 95% OF FEDERAL WORKFORCE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH BIDEN VACCINE REQUIREMENT: SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Doctors have said that the spike is a sign that residents need to be more cautious and continue to follow best practices like masking. \"We need to embrace normalcy at this point, but we need to be smart about it,\" Dr. Ulysses Wu, an infectious disease specialist at Hartford HealthCare, told the Hartford Courant. \"Who are the people you are going to be hanging out with, how many people are going to be coming, and what is their vaccination status?\" Four of the five states with the highest recent increase in virus cases are in New England, the newspaper said. Other hot spots have developed in cold-weather states like Michigan, Minnesota and New York , causing hospitals to scramble. Walensky and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci have pushed for the roughly 60 million unvaccinated Americans to get the shot, and last week , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and CDC recommended booster shots for all adults 18 and older who received a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine at least six months after their second dose.  Video More than 36 million people have already received a dose of vaccine beyond their original vaccination. While all three vaccines used in the U.S. continue to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19 illness and death, the shotsâ effectiveness against milder infection can wane over time. \"Heading into the winter months, when respiratory viruses are more likely to spread, and with plans for increased holiday season travel and gatherings, boosting peopleâs overall protection against COVID-19 disease and death was important to do now,\" Walensky said.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated the decision of Disney World to halt its employee vaccine mandate showed how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis takes \"steps backward\" when it comes to fighting the pandemic . \"They're based in Florida, and obviously the governor there has consistently taken steps to take steps backwards as it relates to fighting the pandemic, not forward,\" Psaki responded Monday when asked aboard Air Force one what more the White House could do after companies such as Disney decided to do away with their vaccine mandates for employees after a stay of President Biden's workplace vaccine mandate was issued in federal court last week.   White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) FLORIDA GOV. DESANTIS TROLLS PRESIDENT BIDEN, SIGNS BILLS LIMITING VACCINE MANDATES IN BRANDON, FL Psaki's comments come after DeSantis signed four bills last week requiring private employers to allow vaccine exemptions, including but not limited to health or religious concerns, pregnancy or anticipated future pregnancy and past recovery from COVID-19. \"Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed COVID mandates, and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida,\" DeSantis said of the legislation. Walt Disney World announced on Saturday that it was pausing its COVID-19 vaccine mandate in response to the new law. \"We believe that our approach to mandatory vaccines has been the rightÂ one as weâve continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our cast members and guests, and at this point, more than 90% of active Florida-based cast members have already verified that they are fully vaccinated,\" a Disney spokesperson said. \"We will address legal developments as appropriate.\"    (Fox News) The Biden administration earlier in November finalized a mandate that required businesses with more than 100 employees to have their workers vaccinated or subjected to weekly testing, but the rule was suspended by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which later ruled to uphold the stay on the order. In response, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced that it was abiding by the court order and would \"take no steps to implement or enforce\" the rule \"until further court order.\" Despite the loss in court, Psaki struck an optimistic tone that many businesses would require vaccinations even without a mandate.

Severe COVID-19 patients had 94% survival rate after treatment, phase II clinical trial reveals    By Talia Kaplan   | Fox News   Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Comments  Print  Email   close   Video  Fox News Flash top headlines for November 23  Fox News Flash top headlines are here.Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.FIRST ON FOX: An Israeli public company says it developed the \"only cure for late-stage COVID \" and said that the results of its phase II clinical trial, disclosed first to Fox News, revealed that patients suffering from severe cases of COVID-19 had a 94% survival rate after being treated with the drug.Israeli biotechnology company Bonus BioGroupâs cell therapy MesenCure was administered to 50 hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffering from life-threatening pneumonia and respiratory distress, the company said, noting that 47 of those patients had survived.\"These are the most clinically meaningful results presented today for treating severe COVID-19 patients,\" Dr. Tomer Bronshtein, the head of research at Bonus BioGroup Ltd., told Fox News in an exclusive interview.Bronshtein said the phase II clinical trial, which recently concluded and took place in several medical centers in Israel, revealed that MesenCure can \"save three out of four people that are at risk of dying\" and \"can reduce their hospital length of stay by half.\"He said it \"will accelerate their healing in a way that will cause less permanent tissue damage and reduce the risk for â long COVID .â\"   Israeli biotechnology company Bonus BioGroupâs cell therapy MesenCure (Bonus BioGroup) The company noted that for each of the first 30 participants in the clinical trial, two patients, also suffering from severe cases, with similar ages and comorbidities, were selected to the \"control group,\" which did not receive MesenCure.After analyzing the data, the company found that Mesencure reduced about 70% of severe COVID-19 patientsâ mortality compared to the mortality in the group that did not receive the drug.The company also noted that about half of the patients with severe cases of COVID-19 who were treated with the therapy were discharged from the hospital up to just one day after the end of the treatment.FAUCI: COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATIONS RISING AMONG VACCINATED \"MesenCure is a drug made from living cells,\" Bronshtein explained, noting that

four bills last week requiring private employers to allow vaccine exemptions    By Michael Lee   | Fox News   Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Comments  Print  Email   close   Video  Fox News Flash top headlines for November 22  Fox News Flash top headlines are here.Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated the decision of Disney World to halt its employee vaccine mandate showed how Florida Gov.Ron DeSantis takes \"steps backward\" when it comes to fighting the pandemic .\"They're based in Florida, and obviously the governor there has consistently taken steps to take steps backwards as it relates to fighting the pandemic, not forward,\" Psaki responded Monday when asked aboard Air Force one what more the White House could do after companies such as Disney decided to do away with their vaccine mandates for employees after a stay of President Biden's workplace vaccine mandate was issued in federal court last week.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) FLORIDA GOV.DESANTIS TROLLS PRESIDENT BIDEN, SIGNS BILLS LIMITING VACCINE MANDATES IN BRANDON, FL Psaki's comments come after DeSantis signed four bills last week requiring private employers to allow vaccine exemptions, including but not limited to health or religious concerns, pregnancy or anticipated future pregnancy and past recovery from COVID-19.\"Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed COVID mandates, and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida,\" DeSantis said of the legislation.Walt Disney World announced on Saturday that it was pausing its COVID-19 vaccine mandate in response to the new law.\"We believe that our approach to mandatory vaccines has been the rightÂ one as weâve continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our cast members and guests, and at this point, more than 90% of active Florida-based cast members have already verified that they are fully vaccinated,\" a Disney spokesperson said.\"We will address legal developments as appropriate.\"(Fox News) The Biden administration earlier in November finalized a mandate that required businesses with more than 100 employees to have their workers vaccinated or subjected to weekly testing, but the rule was suspended by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which later ruled to uphold the stay on the order.In response, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced that it was abiding by the court order and would \"take no steps to implement or enforce\" the rule \"until further court order.\"Despite the loss in court, Psaki struck an optimistic tone that many businesses would require vaccinations even without a mandate.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   \"I would note that a recent poll showed that 60% of business leaders wanted to move forward on their own with vaccine requirement,\" she said.\"We've seen them implemented, at a lot of companies, they've been effective, and overall it gives a lot of businesses certainty about their workforce, makes people feel more confident in coming back to work.\"But Psaki also made clear that the stay will continue to be \"litigated through the process,\" while in the meantime, the administration will continue \"encouraging companies to take steps to protect their workforce.\"Michael Lee is a writer at Fox News.Follow him on Twitter @UAMichaelLee                  Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first

coronavirus cases in the United States ticking up before Thanksgiving despite the proliferation of vaccines, many state and local health officials say Americans' Thanksgiving gatherings cannot go back to normal â whether they are vaccinated or not, but especially if they are not.Los Angeles County Public Health is advising people to avoid traveling if unvaccinated, see as few other families as possible, and mask up around people from different households.\"Keep your gathering small.Avoid mixing with many different families,\" it says in its official Thanksgiving COVID guidance.\"Donât be afraid to ask about peopleâs vaccination status and recent risks before joining a Thanksgiving gathering.\"\"Wear face masks when gathering indoors with people not from your household, except when eating and drinking.\"the Los Angeles County guidance continues.\"Bring a mask to wear outside if the gathering is crowded, especially with people who are unvaccinated or are at increased risk of severe disease.\"A child wears a face mask on the first day of New York City schools, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Brooklyn, New York, U.S. September 13, 2021.REUTERS/Brendan

to test guests before gathering.The City of Pasadena put out nearly identical guidance.The state of Vermont also had a similar message, with a warning that even those closest to you could be vectors for COVID-19.\"Keep it small.The more people and households, the higher the chance that someone could have the virus and expose other people,\" it said in its Thanksgiving guidance.\"Even people you trust the most can have the virus and not know it.\"Even people you trust the most can have the virus and not know it.â Vermont Department of Health The state and local recommendations come as the COVID-19 pandemic is approximately in its 20th month, and its second holiday season.Over 770,000 Americans have died from the disease, according to numbers compiled by Johns Hopkins .But highly effective vaccines are now available to nearly every single person in America, and boosters available to older people most vulnerable to the disease.Negative effects of pandemic mitigation measures

telling Americans they should keep their Thanksgiving gatherings small in 2021.(iStock) \"Keep indoor gatherings small,\" Illinois' Thanksgiving guidance says.\"Arrange seating and other areas to allow for physical distanceâ¦ Avoid having people congregate, such as in the kitchen or at the buffet.\"Sonoma County, Calif., issued similarly strict advice.\"At all times, unvaccinated people should wear a mask indoors and maintain social distancing of 6 feet when meeting with people outside their immediate family,\" it said.\"The mask, which should be at least two-ply and preferably three-ply, should cover your nose and mouth.\"Virginia's Department of Health also appears to be encouraging masks at Thanksgiving.THANKSGIVING DINNER: 5 RECIPES TO WIN OVER EVERYONE'S TASTE BUDS

boosters.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If you're vaccinated, and hopefully you'll be boosted too, and your family is, you can enjoy a typical Thanksgiving meal, Thanksgiving holiday with your family.There's no reason not to do that,\" Fauci said on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.But Fauci didn't directly address Thanksgiving for unvaccinated people in those comments, and health officials like Washington Secretary of Health Umair Shah say those people especially should be modifying their celebrations.\"There is still risk if you are not vaccinated.We want people to understand that risk.Traveling, gathering, families that may have people who are not fully vaccinated who are coming together, those are people who may be putting themselves or others at risk,\" Shah said last

But out in the perennial beds, thereâs one last blast of color: ignitions of goldenrod, flamboyant asters, spiraling mums, all those flashy spikes waving in the wind, conducting summerâs final notes. The ornamental grasses have gone to seed, haloed in the last light. Nights grow chilly, but the days are still warm; I wear the sun like a shawl on my neck and arms. Hundreds of blackbirds ribbon in, settle in the trees, so many black leaves, then, just as suddenly, theyâre gone. This is autumnâs great Departure Gate, and everyone, boarding passes in hand, waits patiently in a long, long line.',\n",
